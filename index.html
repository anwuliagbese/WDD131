            <p>Nigeria, located in West Africa, is a country with a rich and complex history that spans thousands of years. The region was home to ancient civilizations such as the Nok culture, known for its terracotta sculptures dating back to around 500 BC, and the Kingdoms of Ife and Benin, which were renowned for their art and advanced political structures.European contact began in the late 15th century, primarily driven by trade, including the transatlantic slave trade. In the 19th century, British colonization took hold, culminating in the amalgamation of the Northern and Southern Protectorates in 1914 to form modern Nigeria. The country gained independence from Britain on October 1, 1960.</p>
