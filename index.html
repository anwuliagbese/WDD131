            <p>Hello! My name is Anwuli Joyce Agbese. I am a mother of three beautiful daughters. I love singing, reading, and cooking. I am excited and eager to learn web fundamentals. I come from a family of eight, consisting of my father, mother, and five brothers! So that makes me the only daughter of my parents. I look forward to earning a degree in software development and getting a good job.</p>

                <p>Akwa Ibom State is a state in the South-South geopolitical zone of Nigeria, bordered on the east by Cross River State, on the west by Rivers State and Abia State, and on the south by the Atlantic Ocean. The state takes its name from the Qua Iboe River which bisects the state before flowing into the Bight of Bonny. Akwa Ibom was split from Cross River State in 1987 with her capital Uyo and with 31 local government areas. Of the 36 states, Akwa Ibom is the 30th largest in area and fifteenth most populous with an estimated population of nearly 5.5 million as of 2016.</p>
